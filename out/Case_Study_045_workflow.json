Confirm Globex Corp as the focal company using Pipedrive filter_id \"cost_cutting_success\" (status = \"won\", limit = 5) and select Deal ID 101 - \"Cost Reduction Initiative - Globex Corp\".\n2. Gather before/after financial data:\n   - Tableau site ID \"globex_fin\" - retrieve workbooks:\n     - \"Globex Financials - Pre Cost Cut\" (wb_pre, created 2023-12-31)\n     - \"Globex Financials - Post Cost Cut\" (wb_post, created 2024-06-30)\n   - Google Analytics 4 property \"GA4_GLOBEX\" totalRevenue:\n     - Pre-cut period 2023-07-01 -> 2023-12-31 = $1,250,000\n     - Post-cut period 2024-01-01 -> 2024-06-30 = $1,480,000\n3. Review Confluence page(s) in space \"COSTCUT\" titled \"Globex Cost-Cutting Strategies\" (page ID p001) to document the initiatives: supplier contract renegotiation, 60 percent cloud migration, invoice-processing automation, retirement of non-profitable products.\n4. Collect and present impact metrics confirmed by function outputs:\n   - Absolute revenue increase: $230,000\n   - Percentage revenue increase: 18.4 percent\n   - Supplier spend reduction: 12 percent across top-10 suppliers\n   - Invoice cycle-time reduction: 4 days -> 8 hours (-83 percent)\n5. Use data from CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics, Zoho), service/incident platforms (ServiceNow, Zendesk), communications (Slack, Microsoft Teams, Gmail) and analytics/visualisation tools (Adobe Analytics, Looker, Mixpanel) to enrich the narrative where relevant; do not fabricate figures or assets.\n6. Analyse the effect on profitability and operational efficiency.\n7. Draft the narrative with the following sections in this order: Executive Summary, Challenges, Strategy, Implementation, Results & Impact, Visual References, Conclusion & Next Steps.\n8. Insert explicit visual references:\n   - Tableau workbooks wb_pre and wb_post\n   - Looker dashboards:\n     - \"Globex Financial KPIs Pre vs Post Cost-Cut\" (dash_pre_post_fin)\n     - \"Operational Efficiency Metrics\" (dash_efficiency)\n   - Confluence page p001\n   - When listing Looker dashboards, request fields: id,title,description\n9. Include a title page line (\"Globex Corp Cost-Cutting Success Story\"), clear section breaks, and the footer: \"(C) 2024 Globex Corp. All rights reserved. For authorised distribution only.\"\n10. Produce a polished, external-ready document autonomously without further user review, embedding only verified facts.\n\nCase Study ID: CASESTUDY_COSTCUTTING_20240705\n\n**API Keys and Tokens**:\n- PIPEDRIVE_TOKEN: pd_live_abc123\n- TABLEAU_TOKEN: tbl_live_234abc\n- CONFLUENCE_TOKEN: conf_live_345bcd\n- GA4_TOKEN: ga4_live_456cde\n- LOOKER_TOKEN: looker_live_567def\n- WRITER_API_KEY: writer_live_678ef0\n"
