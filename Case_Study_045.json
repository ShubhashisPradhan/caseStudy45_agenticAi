Confirm Globex Corp as the focal company using Pipedrive filter_id “cost_cutting_success” (status = “won”, limit = 5) and select Deal ID 101 – “Cost Reduction Initiative – Globex Corp”.\n2. Gather before/after financial data:\n   • Tableau site ID “globex_fin” – retrieve workbooks:\n     – “Globex Financials – Pre Cost Cut” (wb_pre, created 2023-12-31)\n     – “Globex Financials – Post Cost Cut” (wb_post, created 2024-06-30)\n   • Google Analytics 4 property “GA4_GLOBEX” totalRevenue:\n     – Pre-cut period 2023-07-01 → 2023-12-31 = $1,250,000\n     – Post-cut period 2024-01-01 → 2024-06-30 = $1,480,000\n3. Review Confluence page(s) in space “COSTCUT” titled “Globex Cost-Cutting Strategies” (page ID p001) to document the initiatives: supplier contract renegotiation, 60 % cloud migration, invoice-processing automation, retirement of non-profitable products.\n4. Collect and present impact metrics confirmed by function outputs:\n   • Absolute revenue increase: $230,000\n   • Percentage revenue increase: 18.4 %\n   • Supplier spend reduction: 12 % across top-10 suppliers\n   • Invoice cycle-time reduction: 4 days → 8 hours (-83 %)\n5. Use data from CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics, Zoho), service/incident platforms (ServiceNow, Zendesk), communications (Slack, Microsoft Teams, Gmail) and analytics/visualisation tools (Adobe Analytics, Looker, Mixpanel) to enrich the narrative where relevant; do not fabricate figures or assets.\n6. Analyse the effect on profitability and operational efficiency.\n7. Draft the narrative with the following sections in this order: Executive Summary, Challenges, Strategy, Implementation, Results & Impact, Visual References, Conclusion & Next Steps.\n8. Insert explicit visual references:\n   • Tableau workbooks wb_pre and wb_post\n   • Looker dashboards:\n     – “Globex Financial KPIs Pre vs Post Cost-Cut” (dash_pre_post_fin)\n     – “Operational Efficiency Metrics” (dash_efficiency)\n   • Confluence page p001\n9. Include a title page line (“Globex Corp Cost-Cutting Success Story”), clear section breaks, and the footer: “© 2024 Globex Corp. All rights reserved. For authorised distribution only.”\n10. Produce a polished, external-ready document autonomously without further user review, embedding all verified facts and omitting any unverified placeholders.\n\nCase Study ID: CASESTUDY_COSTCUTTING_20240705"
